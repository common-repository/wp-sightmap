This plugin provides an easy way to integrate the SightMap product by Engrain into your WordPress website.

== Description ==

SightMap is an interactive map application for anyone who interacts with an apartment, self storage facility, or other multi-unit property. It provides the easiest way for renters to search available units, as well as for anyone else interacting with the property to find their way.

SightMap Embed provides multiple ways to include your property's SightMap in your website. It supports multiple styles - including a pop-up, or an inline frame - as well as an API so you can directly link to individual mapped units from your website's floor plan listings or other directories.

If you have integrated your property management system with SightMap (e.g. Yardi, RealPage, ResMan, Entrata), your map may also show pricing and availability information to prospective renters, and will also support any rich media or conversion actions you have put in place.
